# Polymorphism with CPP

Polymorphism implementation using c++

 - main.cpp is the  starting point.
 - Polymorphism enable to manipulate objects of a friend class via pointers or references over a super class.
 - Two necessity integration should be: virtual functions and pointers or references on object
 - If we don't know how to put on the body of super classes body, we could declare it as pure virtaul
 - A class with pure virtual method it called abstrait. We cannot create object from this kind of class.
